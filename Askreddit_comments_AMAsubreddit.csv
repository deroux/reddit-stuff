This is a really random quote that stuck with me forever. I don't have any disease like him, but I still feel trapped and stuck by this body, by a system, by relationships, by responsibilities.

A Brief History of Time rocketed Hawking to stardom.   
>Published for the first time in 1988, the title made the Guinness Book of Records after it stayed on the Sunday Times bestsellers list for an unprecedented 237 weeks. 


His life was played out in biographies and documentaries, most recently *The Theory of Everything,* in which Eddie Redmayne played him. “**At times I thought he was me**,” Hawking said on watching the film.

36,t3_84anfy,"Diagnosed with ALS in his 20's doctors gave him 5 years to live tops

He managed to make it all the way to 76. On the way he proved that black holes actually emit a form of radiation contrary to the previously held believe that they are inescapable for all forms of matter; and inspired an entire generation of young scientists. Hawking is a model that not just scientists but all people everywhere alike should strive to be like.

When i was growing up, we would call smart people einstein. No doubt Hawking will become the einstein of younger generations, and his legacy remembered forever

""After sleeping through a hundred million centuries we have finally opened our eyes on a sumptuous planet, sparkling with color, bountiful with life. Within decades we must close our eyes again.

141,t3_84anfy,"My Dad passed away of the same disease when I was a kid, so Hawking's life and story has always held some sentimental value to me.

His intellect is only outmatched by his humor and positivity. This is the marker of a truly remarkable human being. 

He was able to joke about his regressive state: 'My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21. Everything since then has been a bonus.'. 

Positive about life: 'However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While there's life, there is hope.'

And he always carried a sense of humor: 'The downside of my celebrity is that I cannot go anywhere in the world without being recognized. It is not enough for me to wear dark sunglasses and a wig. The wheelchair gives me away.' 

His life is the kind we can all borrow inspiration from. His passing should remind us all to live our lives following our greatest avocations while playing the cards we are dealt. We have lost a truly, one of a kind human being. 

With that said 'Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet.' is what I will leave you with. Rest in Peace. ",t3_84anfy

Once an incredibly gifted child, parental abuse, depression and various suicide attempts numbed me down, and they kept the curiousity I once had for the world on lowlight. Everybody always told me I would make it big, but I wasn't equipped to use my intelligence to its fullest potential, let alone see it.

I always dreamed of being a neurologist, of possibly discovering brain transplantation, even during the times I lost my will to live. So that I could find a way to give somebody else my life, my intelligence, just to make sure my life wasn't wasted, and then off myself.

Stephen Hawking reignited that spark in me, that curiosity, that will to carry on. After horribly failing my biology final exam due to a panic attack, I was ready to die. My dream was over. But his stories and his tellings kept me going, the way he looked up to death so peace- and mindfully, the way he had such acceptance for everything.

>God may not play dice with the universe

This quote you chose is interesting though. It's something Einstein said, and it doesn't really have anything to do with God or chance/destiny. It was about quantum mechanics. Einstein didn't like the theory, because he subscribed to scientific determinism, the idea that anything can be predicted through science. Quantum mechanics is all about probabilities, and it makes it impossible to predict exactly what will happen at any given time. Quantum mechanics theorizes that a particle is essentially a probability distribution (a wave function), and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that the more accurately you measure a particle's position, the less accurately you are able to measure its momentum (and therefore its velocity). This is defined by ΔxΔp > hπ, where Δx is uncertainty in position, Δp is uncertainty in momentum, and h is Planck's constant. Because of this inherent uncertainty built into quantum mechanics, it makes it impossible to predict exactly how a particle will behave in the future. As I said earlier, Einstein didn't like this, and he said ""God does not play dice with the universe"" in criticism of quantum mechanics.

Stephen Hawking gave a lecture titled ""Does God  Play Dice"" in which he argued that not only is quantum mechanics a valid theory (this was widely accepted by this point as it's been experimentally verified over and over), but black holes further hurt the case of scientific determinism because they destroy information, making it even more difficult to predict the future. So, interestingly enough, Hawking's conclusion is that God *does* play dice with the universe.

**TL;DR** Hawking gave a lecture in which he concluded that God does play dice with the universe.

294,t1_dvo6ce6,"I recall a conversation from a few years ago where a couple doctors were discussing Hawking and his ALS diagnosis. Because literally almost no one survives as long as he had with ALS, they were convinced that he must have some other disease, perhaps a disease that medical science isn't yet aware of. So maybe he survived so long because he had something similar to ALS, but different.",t3_84anfy
295,t1_dvo6ce6,"My dad had ALS and died about 4 months ago. Which was only 1 year after his first symptom.

At his funeral, many of his friends / coworkers told our family that he was the smartest man they had ever met. He was a lead electrical engineer. He has a great relationship with my mom, tons of friends, passions, and a stable positive outlook on life. He enjoyed being alive and wanted to be here. 

When he was getting weaker, the doctors made sure we knew that your will to live doesn’t matter much in fighting the disease. ALS doesn’t care how hard you fight it or how smart you are. It’s going to run its course the way it will regardless. Every case of the disease is different.

Resources like a feeding tube and ventilator can help extend your life. So I would consider having those installed to be “fighting the disease.” My dad didn’t want to extend his life with those because he couldn’t move his arms or legs, sit up, enjoy food, use the toilet, or breathe on his own. So what’s the point in extending a condition that requires strenuous 24/7 caregiving? Which is totally understandable because I wouldn’t either (no offense to anyone who decides to, but it’s very much a personal decision).

I really appreciate you asking this question because as Ive been reading through comments that say he’s so strong for fighting the disease, I can’t help but want to scream “that’s not how it works!” I know it’s a common phrase to use with any disease, and I’m not actually offended or upset. But I do know that if someone with ALS could slow or change the course of the disease with their mindset or intelligence level, my dad and many other people would still be around.",t3_84anfy
