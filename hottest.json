So they kept it quiet. \n\nOh, one more thing that I haven't actually mentioned until now. In the beginning, for the first few months, they were operating with a paper-thin excuse handed to them when my grandmother (Dad's ex-wife) who is far from the greatest person, told them that my mom wasn't his. That she was some other man's kid. \n\nThing is, my grandma is a compulsive liar and she WAS lying. And I think they both probably kind of figured she might be. But nonetheless, it was only a month or so before they slept together for the first time. They didn't do DNA tests or anything. They just said \"Well, turns out we're not related, so it's fine.\" And after they got it verified from my Grandma that she was lying, like two months later they decided \"It's already happened, no turning back now.\" \n\nBut really, I think they knew the whole time."

(For my dad it was dishes, he would always leave them in the sink. For my mom it was laundry, she would leave hers everywhere.)

I'd see them dance together in the living room, and they'd go out some nights when I had a babysitter and when I was old enough not to need one.
