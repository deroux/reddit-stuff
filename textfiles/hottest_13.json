I, luckily, am able to masturbation. I do still cry, occasionally. I told my parents and didn't know how bad it was. The police did get involved. We don't talk at all. It kind of tore apart the family. I don't hold anger at him anymore, only disgust and anxiety (if that makes sense). It's all very complicated. I did get therapy which stopped when I was 12, with the occasional appointments now. It may be linked to all my mental illness, though I'm not sure.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/w2dy61/i_was_raped_by_a_cousin_at_6_years_old_ama/igplo5y/)What did your family do when they found out?|My dad went to the cousin's house and asked him if it was true for a few weeks.
